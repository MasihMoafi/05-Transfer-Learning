Neural Style Transfer with PyTorch

This Jupyter Notebook contains PyTorch implementations of neural style transfer, a technique that combines the style of one image with the content of another. Two different implementations are provided, one using VGG19 as the base model and another using a custom ResNet-based model.
Usage

Dependencies

The notebook requires the following dependencies:

    PyTorch
    torchvision
    PIL
    matplotlib

Pretrained Models

The VGG19 model pretrained on ImageNet is automatically downloaded and used in the VGG19-based implementation.

The neural style transfer code is adapted from various sources and tutorials, which are mentioned within the notebook.
